== An Epistle to the Quarterly and Monthly Meetings of Friends.

Beloved Friends,
Feeling at this time a renewed concern that the pure Spirit of light and life,
and the righteous fruits thereof, may spread and prevail amongst mankind,
there is an engagement on my heart to labour with my brethren in religious profession,
that none of us may be a stumbling-block in the way of others;
but that we may so walk that our conduct may reach the pure witness
in the hearts of those who are not in profession with us.

And, dear friends, while we publicly own that the holy Spirit is our leader,
the profession is in itself weighty, and the weightiness thereof increases,
in proportion as we are noted among the professors of Truth,
and active in dealing with those who walk disorderly.

Many under our profession for want of due attention,
and a perfect resignation to this Divine teacher,
have in some things manifested a deviation from the purity of our religious principles,
and these deviations having crept in amongst us by little and little,
and increasing from less to greater, have been so far unnoticed,
that some living in them, have been active in putting discipline in practice,
with relation to others, whose conduct has appeared more dishonourable in the world.

As my mind hath been exercised before the Lord,
I have seen that the discipline of the church of Christ standeth in that which is pure;
that it is the wisdom from above which gives authority to discipline;
and that the weightiness thereof standeth not in any outward circumstances,
but in the authority of Christ who is the author of it;
and where any walk after the flesh, and not according to the purity of Truth,
and at the same time are active in putting discipline in practice,
a veil is gradually drawn over its purity, and over that holiness of life,
which Christ leads those into, "`in whom the love of God is verily perfected.`"

When we labour in true love with offenders, and they remain obstinate,
it sometimes is necessary to proceed as far as our Lord directed,
"`Let him be to thee as an heathen man, or a publican.`"

When such are disowned, and they who act therein feel Christ made unto them wisdom,
and are preserved in his meek, restoring spirit,
there is no just cause of offence ministered to any;
but when those who are active in dealing with offenders indulge
themselves in things which are contrary to the purity of Truth,
and yet judge others whose conduct appears more dishonourable than theirs,
here the pure authority of discipline ceaseth as to such offenders,
and a temptation is laid in their way to wrangle and contend.
"`Judge not,`" said our Lord, "`that ye be not judged.`"
This forbidding alludes to man`'s judgment,
and points out the necessity of humbly attending to that sanctifying power under
which the faithful experience the Lord to be "`a spirit of judgment to them.`"
And as we feel his holy Spirit to mortify the deeds of the body in us, and can say,
"`it is no more I that live,
but Christ that liveth in me,`" here right judgment is known.

While Divine love prevails in our hearts, and self in us is brought under judgment,
a preparation is felt to labour in a right manner with offenders;
but if we abide not in this love,
our outward performance in dealing with others degenerates into formality;
for "`this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.`"

How weighty are those instructions of our Redeemer concerning religious duties,
when he points out, that they who pray,
should be so obedient to the teachings of the holy Spirit,
that humbly confiding in his help, they may say, "`Thy name O Father be hallowed!

Thy kingdom come; thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.`"
In this awful state of mind is felt that worship
which stands in doing the will of God on earth,
as it is done in heaven, and keeping the holy name sacred.
To take a holy profession upon us is awful, nor can we keep this holy name sacred,
but by humbly abiding under the cross of Christ.
The apostle made a heavy complaint against some who
profaned this holy name by their manner of living;
"`through you,`" he says, "`the name of God is blasphemed amongst the Gentiles.`"

Some of our ancestors through many tribulations
were gathered into the state of true worshippers,
and had fellowship in that which is pure,
and as one was inwardly moved to kneel down in their
assemblies and publicly call on the name of the Lord,
those in the harmony of united exercise then present, joined in the prayer.
I mention this in order that we of the present age may
look unto the Rock from whence we were hewn,
and remember that to unite in worship, is a union in prayer,
and that prayer is acceptable to the Father which is in a mind truly sanctified,
where the sacred name is kept holy,
and the heart resigned to do his will on earth as it is done in heaven.
"`If ye abide in me,`" saith Christ, "`and my words abide in you,
ye shall ask what ye will in my name, and it shall be done unto you.`"
We know not what to pray for as we ought,
but as the holy Spirit doth open and direct our minds,
and as we faithfully yield to its influences,
our prayers are in the will of our heavenly Father,
who fails not to grant that which his own Spirit, through his children,
asketh;--thus preservation from sin is known,
and the fruits of righteousness are brought forth by such who inwardly unite in prayer.

How weighty are our solemn meetings when the name of Christ is
kept holy! "`How precious is that state in which the children
of the Lord are so redeemed from the love of this world,
that they are accepted and blessed in all that they do.`"
R+++.+++ Barclay`'s Apology, p. 404.

How necessary is it that we who profess these principles,
and are active in supporting them, should faithfully abide in Divine strength,
that "`As He who hath called us is holy,
so we may be holy in all manner of conversation.`"

If one professing to be influenced by the Spirit of Christ,
proposes to unite in a labour to promote righteousness in the earth,
and in time past he hath manifestly deviated from the path of equity,
then to act consistently with this principle,
his first work is to make restitution so far as he may be enabled;
for if he attempts to contribute toward a work intended to promote righteousness,
while it appears that he neglecteth, or refuseth to act righteously himself,
his conduct has a tendency to entangle the minds of those who are weak in the faith,
who behold these things, and to draw a veil over the purity of righteousness,
by carrying an appearance as though that was righteousness which is not.

Again,
if I propose to assist in supporting those doctrines
wherein that purity of life is held forth,
in which customs proceeding from the spirit of this world have no place,
and at the same time strengthen others in those customs by my example;
the first step in an orderly proceeding, is to cease from those customs myself,
and afterwards to labour, as I may be enabled,
to promote the like disposition and conduct in others.

To be convinced of the pure principle of Truth,
and diligently exercised in walking answerably thereto,
is necessary before I can consistently recommend this principle to others.
I often feel a labour in spirit,
that we who are active members in religious society may
experience in ourselves the truth of those expressions of the
holy One--"`I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me.`"
In this case,
my mind hath been often exercised when alone year after year for many years,
and in the renewings of Divine love, a tender care hath been incited in me,
that we who profess the light of Christ Jesus to be our teacher,
may be a family united in that purity of worship, which comprehends a holy life,
and ministers instruction to others.

My mind is often drawn towards children in the Truth,
who having a small share of the things of this life, and coming to have families,
may be exercised before the Lord to support them
in a way agreeable to the purity of Truth,
in which they may feel His blessing upon them in their labours.
The thought of such being entangled with customs, contrary to pure wisdom,
conveyed to them through our hands, often very tenderly and movingly affects my heart;
and when I look towards and think on the succeeding generation,
fervent desires are raised in me,
that by yielding to that holy Spirit which leads into all Truth,
we may not do the work of the Lord deceitfully,
may not live contrary to the purity of the Divine light we profess;
but that as faithful labourers in our age,
we may be instrumental in removing stumbling-blocks out
of the way of those who may succeed us.

So great was the love of Christ, that he gave himself for the church,
that he might sanctify and cleanse it, that it should be holy, and without blemish,
not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing.
Where any take the name of Christ upon them, professing to be members of his church,
and to be led by his holy Spirit, and yet manifestly deviate from the purity of Truth,
they herein act against the gracious design of his giving himself for them,
and minister cause for the continuance of his afflictions in his body, the church.

Christ suffered afflictions in a body of flesh prepared by the Father,
but the afflictions of his mystical body are yet unfinished;
for they who are baptized into Christ are baptized into his death,
and as we humbly abide under his sanctifying power,
and are brought forth into newness of life, we feel Christ to live in us, who,
being the same yesterday, today, and for ever, and always at unity with himself,
his Spirit in the hearts of his people leads to
an inward exercise for the salvation of mankind.
When under a travail of spirit,
we behold a visited people entangled by the spirit of
this world with its wickedness and customs,
and thereby rendered incapable of being faithful examples to others,
sorrow and heaviness under a sense of these things, are often experienced,
and thus in some measure is filled up that which remains of the afflictions of Christ.

Our blessed Saviour speaking concerning gifts offered in Divine service, says,
"`If thou bring thy gift to the altar,
and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee,
leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way,
first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.`"
Now there is no true unity, but in that wherein the Father and the Son are united,
nor can there be a perfect reconciliation but in ceasing from that which
ministers cause for the continuation of the afflictions of Christ;
and if any professing to bring their gift to the altar,
do remember the customary contradiction which some of their fruits bear to the pure,
spiritual worship, here it appears necessary to lay to heart this command,
"`leave thy gift by the altar.`"

Christ graciously calls his people brethren;
"`whosoever shall do the will of God the same is my brother.`"
If we walk contrary to the Truth as it is in Jesus while we continue to profess it,
we offend against Christ, and if under this offence we bring our gift to the altar,
our Redeemer doth not direct us to take back our gift,
he doth not discourage our proceeding in a good work;
but graciously points out the necessary means by
which the gift may be rendered acceptable;
"`leave,`" saith he, "`thy gift by the altar,
first go and be reconciled to thy brother,`"
cease from that which grieves the holy Spirit,
cease from that which is against the Truth as it is in Jesus,
and then come and offer thy gift.

I feel, while I am writing, a tenderness to those who through Divine favour,
are preserved in a lively sense of the state of the churches,
and at times may be under discouragements with regard to proceeding
in that pure way which Christ by his holy Spirit leads into.
The depth of disorder and weakness, which so much prevails, being opened,
doublings are apt to arise as to the possibility of proceeding as an
assembly of the Lord`'s people in the pure counsel of Truth;
and here I feel a concern to express in uprightness,
that which hath been opened in my mind, under the power of the cross of Christ,
relating to a visible gathered church, the members whereof are guided by the holy Spirit.

The church is called the body of Christ, Col. 1:25.
Christ is called the head of the church, Eph. 1:22.
The church is called the pillar and ground of Truth, 1 Tim. 3:15.
Thus the church hath a name that is sacred,
and the necessity of keeping this name holy, appears evident;
for where a number of people unite in a profession of being led by the Spirit of Christ,
and publish their principles to the world,
the acts and proceedings of that people may in some measure be
considered as those of which Christ is the author.

While we stand in this station,
if the pure light of life is not followed and regarded in our proceedings,
we are in the way of profaning the holy name,
and of going back toward that wilderness of sufferings and persecution, out of which,
through the tender mercies of God, a church hath been gathered.
"`Christ liveth in sanctified vessels,`" and where they behold his holy name profaned,
and the pure Gospel light eclipsed through the unfaithfulness of any who by
their station appear to be standard bearers under the Prince of peace,
the living members in the body of Christ, beholding these things,
do in some degree experience the fellowship of his sufferings,
and as the wisdom of the world more and more takes place in
conducting the affairs of this visible gathered church,
and the pure leadings of the holy Spirit are less waited for and followed,
so the true suffering seed is more and more oppressed.

My mind is often affected with a sense of the condition
of sincere hearted people in some kingdoms,
where liberty of conscience is not allowed,
many of whom being burthened in their minds with the prevailing superstition,
joined with oppressions, are often under sorrow;
and where such have attended to that pure light which
has in some degree opened their understandings,
and for their faithfulness thereto, have been brought to examination and trial,
how heavy have been the persecutions which in divers
parts of the world have been exercised upon them?
How mighty, as to the outward,
is that power by which they have been borne down and oppressed?

How deeply affecting is the condition of many upright
hearted people who are taken into the papal inquisition?
What lamentable cruelties, in deep vaults, in a private way,
are exercised on many of them?
and how lingering is that death by a small slow fire,
which those have frequently endured who have been faithful to the end?

How many tender-spirited Protestants have been sentenced to
spend the remainder of their lives in a galley chained to oars,
under hardhearted masters, while their young children are placed out for education,
and taught principles so contrary to the consciences of the parents,
that by dissenting from them, they have hazarded their liberty, their lives,
and all that was dear to them of the things of this world?

There have been in time past severe persecutions under the English government,
and many sincere-hearted people have suffered
death for the testimony of a good conscience,
whose faithfulness in their day has ministered encouragement to others,
and been a blessing to many who have succeeded them.
Thus from age to age, the darkness being more and more removed, a channel at length,
through the tender mercies of God,
has been opened for the exercise of the pure gift of the Gospelministry,
without interruption from outward power, a work, the like of which is rare,
and unknown in many parts of the world.

As these things are often fresh in my mind,
and this great work of God going on in the earth has been opened before me,
that liberty of conscience with which we are favoured,
has appeared not to be a light matter.

A trust is committed to us, a great and weighty trust,
to which our diligent attention is necessary.
Wherever the active members of this visible gathered church use
themselves to that which is contrary to the purity of our principles,
it appears to be a breach of this trust, and one step back toward the wilderness;
one step towards undoing what God in infinite love hath done
through his faithful servants in a work of several ages,
and is like laying the foundation for future sufferings.

I feel a living invitation in my mind to those who are active in our religious Society,
that we may lay to heart this matter, and consider the station in which we stand;
a place of outward liberty under the free exercise of our consciences towards God,
not obtained but through the great and manifold afflictions of those who lived before us.
There is gratitude due from us to our heavenly Father, and justice to our posterity.
Can our hearts endure, or our hands be strong, if we desert a cause so precious,
if we turn aside from a work in which so many have patiently laboured?

May the deep sufferings of our Saviour be so dear to us,
that we may never trample under foot the adorable Son of God,
or count the blood of the covenant unholy!
May the faithfulness of the martyrs when the prospect of death by fire was before them,
be remembered!
May the patient constant sufferings of the upright-hearted
servants of God in latter ages be revived in our minds!
May we so follow on to know the Lord, that neither the faithful in this age,
nor those in ages to come, may be brought under suffering,
through our sliding back from the work of reformation in the world!

While the active members in the visible gathered church stand upright,
and the affairs thereof are carried on under the leadings of the holy Spirit,
although disorders may arise among us,
and cause many exercises to those who feel the care of the churches upon them;
yet while these continue under the weight of the work,
and labour in the meekness of wisdom for the help of others,
the name of Christ in the visible gathered church may be kept sacred.
But while they who are active in the affairs of the church,
continue in a manifest opposition to the purity of our principles,
this as the prophet Isaiah expresseth it, is like "`as when a standard bearer fainteth.`"
Thus the way opens to great and prevailing degeneracy, and to sufferings for those who,
through the power of Divine love, are separated to the Gospel of Christ,
and cannot unite with any thing which stands in opposition to the purity of it.

The necessity of an inward stillness,
hath under these exercises appeared clear to my mind.
In true silence strength is renewed, the mind herein is weaned from all things,
but as they may be enjoyed in the Divine will, and a lowliness in outward living,
opposite to worldly honour, becomes truly acceptable to us.
In the desire after outward gain,
the mind is prevented from a perfect attention to the voice of Christ;
but being weaned from all things, but as they may be enjoyed in the Divine will,
the pure light shines into the soul.
Where the fruits of that spirit which is of this world,
are brought forth by many who profess to be led by the Spirit of Truth,
and cloudiness is felt to be gathering over the visible church,
the sincere in heart who abide in true stillness,
and are exercised therein before the Lord for his name sake,
have a knowledge of Christ in the fellowship of his sufferings,
and inward thankfulness is felt at times,
that through Divine love our own wisdom is cast out,
and that forward active part in us subjected,
which would rise and do something in the visible church,
without the pure leadings of the Spirit of Christ.

While aught remains in us different from a perfect resignation of our wills,
it is like a seal to a book wherein is written "`that good and acceptable,
and perfect will of God concerning us;`" but when our minds entirely yield to Christ,
that silence is known, which followeth the opening of the last of the seals, Rev. 8:1.
In this silence we learn to abide in the Divine will,
and there feel that we have no cause to promote but that only
in which the light of life directs us in our proceedings,
and that the alone way to be useful in the church of Christ,
is to abide faithfully under the leadings of his holy Spirit in all cases,
that being preserved thereby in purity of heart and holiness of conversation,
a testimony to the purity of his government may be held forth through us to others.

As my mind hath been thus exercised,
I have seen that to be active and busy in the visible gathered church,
without the leadings of the holy Spirit is not only unprofitable,
but tends to increase dimness,
and where way is not opened to proceed in the light of Truth,
a stop is felt by those who humbly attend to the Divine Leader,
a stop which in relation to good order in the church,
is of the greatest consequence to be observed.
Robert Barclay in his treatise on discipline, holds forth, pages 65, 68, 84,
"`That the judgment or conclusion of the church or congregation,
is no further effectual as to the true end and design thereof,
but as such judgment or conclusion proceeds from the Spirit of God
operating on their minds who are sanctified in Christ Jesus.`"

In this stop I have learned the necessity of waiting on the Lord in humility,
that the works of all may be brought to light,
and those to judgment which are wrought in the wisdom of this world, and have also seen,
that in a mind thoroughly subjected to the power of the cross,
there is a savour of life to be felt, which evidently tends to gather souls to God,
while the greatest works in the visible church, brought forth in man`'s wisdom,
remain to be unprofitable.

Where people are divinely gathered into a holy fellowship,
and faithfully abide under the influence of that Spirit which leads into all truth,
"`they are the light of the world.`"
Holding this profession, to me appears weighty, even beyond what I can fully express,
and what our blessed Lord seemed to have in view,
when he proposed the necessity of counting the cost, before we begin to build.

I trust there are many who at times, under Divine visitation,
feel an inward inquiry after God,
and when such in the simplicity of their hearts mark the lives
of a people who profess to walk by the leadings of his Spirit,
of what great concernment is it that our lights shine clear,
that nothing in our conduct carry a contradiction to the Truth as it is in Jesus,
or be a means of profaning his holy name,
and be a stumbling-block in the way of sincere inquirers.

When such seekers, wearied with empty forms, look towards uniting with us as a people,
and behold active members among us depart in their
customary way of living from that purity of life,
which under humbling exercises has been opened
before them as the way of the Lord`'s people,
how mournful and discouraging is the prospect! and how strongly doth
such unfaithfulness operate against the spreading of the peaceable,
harmonious principles and testimony of truth amongst mankind?

In entering into that life which is hid with Christ in God,
we behold his peaceable government,
where the whole family are governed by the same spirit,
and the "`doing to others as we would they should do
unto us,`" groweth up as good fruit from a good tree:
the peace, quietness,
and harmonious walking in this government is beheld
with humble reverence to Him who is the author of it,
and in partaking of the Spirit of Christ,
we partake of that which labours and suffers for the increase of this
peaceable government among the inhabitants of the world.
I have felt a labour of long continuance that we who profess this peaceable principle,
may be faithful standard-bearers under the Prince of peace,
and that nothing of a defiling nature, tending to discord and wars, may remain among us.

May each of us query with ourselves, have the treasures I possess,
been gathered in that wisdom which is from above, so far as has appeared to me?

Have none of my fellow-creatures an equitable right to any part of what is called mine?

Have the gifts and possessions received by me from others,
been conveyed in a way free from all unrighteousness so far as I have seen?

The principle of peace in which our trust is only on the Lord,
and our minds weaned from a dependance on the strength of armies,
has appeared to me very precious; and I often feel strong desires,
that we who profess this principle, may so walk,
as to give no just cause for any of our fellow-creatures to be offended at us;
and that our lives may evidently manifest,
that we are redeemed from that spirit in which wars are.
Our blessed Saviour in pointing out the danger of so leaning on man,
as to neglect the leadings of his holy Spirit, said,
"`Call no man your father upon the earth; for one is your father which is in heaven.`"
Where the wisdom from above is faithfully followed,
and therein we are entrusted with substance, it is a treasure committed to our care,
in the nature of an inheritance from Him who formed and supports the world.
In this condition the true enjoyment of the good things of this life is understood,
and that blessing felt, in which is real safety;
this is what I apprehend our blessed Lord had in view, when he pronounced,
"`Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.`"

Selfish worldly minded men may hold lands in the selfish spirit,
and depending on the strength of outward power, may be perplexed with secret uneasiness,
lest the injured should at sometime overpower them, and that measure be meted to them,
which they measure to others.
Thus selfish men may possess the earth; but it is the meek who inherit it,
and enjoy it as an inheritance from their heavenly Father,
free from all the defilements and perplexities of unrighteousness.

Where proceedings have been in that wisdom which is from beneath,
and inequitable gain gathered by a man, and left as a gift to his children,
who being entangled by the same worldly spirit,
have not attained to that clearness of light in
which the channels of righteousness are opened,
and justice done to those who remain silent under injuries;
here I have seen under humbling exercise of mind,
thatthe sins of the fathers are embraced by the children, and become their sins,
and thus in the days of tribulation,
the iniquities of the fathers are visited upon these children,
who take hold of the unrighteousness of their fathers,
and live in that spirit in which those iniquities were committed.
To this agreeth the prophecy of Moses, concerning a rebellious people,
"`They that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquities in your enemy`'s land,
and in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away.`"
Our blessed Lord in beholding the hardness of heart in that generation,
and feeling in himself,
that they lived in the same spirit in which the prophets had been persecuted unto death,
signified "`that the blood of all the prophets
which was shed from the foundation of the world,
should be required of that generation, from the blood of Abel,
unto the blood of Zacharias, which perished between the altar and the temple.`"

Tender compassion fills my heart toward my fellow-creatures estranged
from the harmonious government of the Prince of peace,
and a labour attends me, that they may be gathered to this peaceable habitation.

In being inwardly prepared to suffer adversity for Christ`'s sake,
and weaned from a dependance on the arm of flesh,
we feel that there is a rest for the people of God,
and that it stands in a perfect resignation of ourselves to his holy will.
In this condition all our wants and desires are bounded by pure wisdom,
and our minds are wholly attentive to the counsel of Christ inwardly communicated.
This has appeared to me a habitation of safety for the Lord`'s people,
in times of outward commotion and trouble,
and desires from the fountain of pure love are opened in me,
to invite my brethren and fellow-creatures to feel for,
and seek after that which gathers the mind into it.
